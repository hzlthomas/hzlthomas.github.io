						<a href="../default.htm">transfer.zip</a> is a web application that allows you to easily
						transfer files between two devices. At the moment, transfer.zip is the easiest and most secure
						way to share files on the web. There is no signup, no wait and no bullshit, and the files can be
						as large as you want.
					</p>
					<p>
						It uses <a href="../../www.webrtc.org/default.htm">WebRTC</a> for peer-to-peer data transfer, meaning the
						files are streamed directly between peers and not stored anywhere in the process, not even on
						transfer.zip servers. To let peers initially discover each other, a signaling server is
						implemented in NodeJS using WebSockets, which importantly no sensitive data is sent through. In
						addition, the file data is end-to-end encrypted using <a
							href="../../https@en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode">AES-GCM</a> with a client-side 256
						bit generated key, meaning if someone could impersonate a peer or capture the traffic, they
						would not be able to decrypt the file without knowing the key. Because the file is streamed
						directly between peers, there are <b>no file size or bandwidth limitations</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The easiest way to transfer a file is to scan the QR code containing the file link and
						encryption key. It is also possible to copy the link and share it to the receiving end over what
						medium you prefer the most.
					</p>
					<h2>Known Problems</h2>
					<p>
						Because of how peer-to-peer works, some network firewalls may not allow direct connections
						between devices. A solution for this is to use a <a
							href="../../https@webrtc.org/getting-started/turn-server">TURN server</a>, effectively relaying
						all file data, although encrypted, through a third party server. That is however against the
						whole purpose of this service, which is to be as secure as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						On some Safari browsers, the file download will not work because of bugs on Apple's part.
