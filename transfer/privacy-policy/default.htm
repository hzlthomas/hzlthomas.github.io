                    <p>Thank you for visiting Transfer.zip. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect your
                        personal information when you use our website. Please read this policy carefully to understand
                        our
                        practices regarding your data and how we ensure your privacy.</p>

                    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

                    <p>We want to assure you that we do not collect any personal data or personally identifiable
                        information (PII) when you visit Transfer.zip. We have designed our website to be entirely
                        anonymous
                        and respect your privacy.</p>

                    <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>

                    <p>Transfer.zip does not use cookies or any similar tracking technologies. We do not employ any form
                        of
                        analytics or advertising cookies that could track your online activities.</p>

                    <h2>External Links</h2>

                    <p>Our website may contain links to external websites or resources that are not operated or
                        controlled
                        by us. Once you click on these links, you will be redirected to external websites, and their
                        privacy
                        policies will govern the collection and use of your information. We do not have control over the
                        content or practices of these third-party websites and cannot be held responsible for their
                        privacy
                        practices. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any external websites you visit.</p>

                    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

                    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or inquiries regarding this Privacy Policy or the practices
                        of
                        Transfer.zip, you can contact us via the github page. We will make every effort
                        to respond to your communication promptly.</p>

                    <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>

                    <p>We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes made will
                        be
                        effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy on Transfer.zip. We encourage you
                        to
                        review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your
                        information.</p>

                    <h2>Data Security</h2>

                    <p>At Transfer.zip, we prioritize the security and privacy of our users. We have implemented
                        measures
                        to ensure the protection of your data, although we do not collect or store any user information
                        on
                        our servers. Our website operates in a client-side manner, which means that all data processing
                        and
                        storage occur locally on your device.</p>

                    <p>As a result, we do not have access to or control over any data you generate or manipulate on our
                        website. This approach eliminates the need for us to implement specific security measures for
                        user
                        data, as no information is transmitted or stored on our servers. Any data you handle on
                        Transfer.zip
                        remains within the confines of your device and browser.</p>

                    <p>While we take reasonable steps to ensure the security of our website and maintain a safe browsing
                        environment, it is important to remember that the security of your device and browser settings
                        are
                        ultimately your responsibility. We recommend keeping your operating system, browser, and
                        security
                        software up to date to minimize potential risks.</p>

                    <h2>Compliance with Laws</h2>

                    <p>Transfer.zip complies with all applicable data protection laws and regulations. This Privacy
                        Policy
                        is intended to be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant
                        privacy laws.</p>

                    <h2>Consent</h2>

                    <p>By using Transfer.zip, you consent to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy and agree to the
                        collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described herein.</p>

                    <p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using Transfer.zip.</p>

                    <p>Please note that this privacy policy is for informational purposes only and should not be
                        considered
                        as legal advice. For detailed legal advice, please consult a qualified attorney.</p>
